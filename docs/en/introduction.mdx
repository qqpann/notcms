## What is NotCMS?

NotCMS is a headless CMS that uses Notion as your content backend, providing the best of both worlds: Notion's intuitive editor for content creators and a type-safe API for developers.

## Why NotCMS, instead of raw Notion API?

While Notion's API is powerful, using it directly for content management comes with significant challenges:

### Challenges with raw Notion API

- **Complex API queries**: You need to learn Notion's intricate query syntax and property structures
- **No TypeScript support**: Query results lack type definitions, leading to runtime errors and poor IDE support
- **Maintenance nightmare**: When you update Notion properties, you must manually update code across your entire application
- **Content transformation**: You need to write custom code to convert Notion blocks to Markdown or HTML
- **Image hosting issues**: Notion image URLs expire, requiring you to implement your own image re-hosting solution

### How NotCMS solves these problems

NotCMS handles all these complexities for you:

```typescript
// ❌ Raw Notion API - Complex and error-prone
const response = await notion.databases.query({
  database_id: 'abc123',
  filter: {
    property: 'Published',
    checkbox: { equals: true }
  }
});
// No TypeScript support, manual type assertions needed
const title = (response.results[0].properties.Title as any).title[0].plain_text;

// ✅ NotCMS - Simple and type-safe
const [posts, error] = await nc.query.blog.list();
// Full TypeScript support, IDE autocomplete works
posts.forEach(post => console.log(post.title));
```

With NotCMS, you get:
- **Auto-generated TypeScript types** from your Notion databases
- **Simple, intuitive API** that feels natural to JavaScript developers
- **Automatic content transformation** to Markdown
- **Persistent image hosting** that comes out of the box
- **Instantly pull updates with CLI** when your Notion schema changes

## Core Concepts

### Schema-First Approach

NotCMS generates TypeScript schemas from your Notion databases, ensuring type safety throughout your application:

```typescript
// Auto-generated schema
export const schema = {
  blog: {
    id: "your_database_id",
    properties: {
      title: "title",
      published: "checkbox",
      author: "rich_text"
    }
  }
} satisfies Schema;
```

### Type-Safe Queries

Query your content with full TypeScript support:

```typescript
const nc = new Client({ schema });

// Fully typed response
const [posts, error] = await nc.query.blog.list({
  filter: {
    property: "published",
    checkbox: { equals: true }
  }
});
```

### Error Handling

NotCMS uses a tuple-based error handling pattern for predictable error management:

```typescript
const [data, error, response] = await nc.query.blog.get(pageId);

if (error) {
  console.error("Failed to fetch:", error.message);
  return;
}

// Use data safely
console.log(data.title);
```
